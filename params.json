{"name":"Fastjar","tagline":"","body":"=======\r\nFastJar 0.90\r\n\r\n12/6/1999\r\n=======\r\n\r\nFastJar is an attempt at creating a feature-for-feature copy of Sun's JDK's\r\n'jar' command.  Sun's jar (or Blackdown's for that matter) is written entirely\r\nin Java which makes it dog slow.  Since FastJar is written in C, it can create\r\nthe same .jar file as Sun's tool in a fraction of the time.  On my system,\r\nSun's jar takes 50 seconds to create a 10MB jar file, while FastJar only takes\r\na little over a second.  \r\n\r\nThe reason I wrote fastjar is that building .jar files is a regular process\r\nof the build where I work.  The way we have it setup, you have to re-create\r\nthe .jar file everytime you want to test it out, which is about every 5 minutes\r\nwhen I'm busy coding.  The .jar file wasn't -that- big, but it did take about\r\n30 seconds to be made, and watching all the garbage collection messages was\r\npretty irritating as well.  I probably wasted a half-hour a day watching\r\nSun's jar tool chug along.  By writing the program in C, I spend much less time\r\nbanging my head against the monitor waiting for the build to finish.  Yay!\r\n\r\nFastJar has been tested on Solaris and Linux 2.2.x systems and nothing else. \r\nIt should compile/run without any problems on either system, provided you have\r\nzlib installed.  \r\n\r\nPlease mail any bug reports to burnsbr@ucs.orst.edu.\r\n\r\nIf you use FastJar and want me to add the rest of the features, send me mail\r\n(toast@users.sourceforge.net).  I'll be much more likely to put more work into this\r\nif I know other people find it useful other than me.\r\n\r\nAs always, this not being a final release, bugs may exist.  I test each\r\nrelease pretty well, but I can always miss things...\r\n\r\nCompression will slow things down quite a bit.  A 10MB jar file takes about\r\n1 second on my machine without compression, and 9 seconds with it.  If you\r\nwant fastjar to be fast, use the -0 (zero, not O) flag to turn off compression.\r\n\r\nSupported flags:\r\n--------------------------\r\n-c  | create a new archive\r\n-v  | verbose output\r\n-f  | specify archive file name\r\n-m  | specify existing manifest file\r\n-M  | don't create manifest\r\n-0  | store only\r\n-C  | change to dir\r\n-t  | list contents\r\n-x  | extract contents\r\n\r\nUnsupported flags:\r\n----------------------------\r\n-u  | update exisiting archive\r\n\r\nIf you use the \"unsupported\" flags, nothing bad will happen, but then again\r\nnothing will happen at all.  \r\n\r\n\r\nUnsupported features (in this release):\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n  * updating\r\n  * full manifest support (?)\r\n\r\nOrder or features for the future:\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\n  * archive updating\r\n  * full manifest support\r\n  * filtering\r\n  * dependency checking\r\n\r\n\r\n===========================================================================\r\nhttp://fastjar.sourceforge.net\r\ntoast@users.sourceforge.net\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
